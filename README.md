# Which States Have the Most Fires with Undetermined Causes?


## Purpose and Background

There are many fires in the NFIRS database with "undetermined" cause, particularly after 2011.

My app allows users to explore how the number of non-residential fires with "undetermined" causes has changed over time and by state, and determine which years and states have statistically "out of the ordinary" number of fires with undetermined causes.
